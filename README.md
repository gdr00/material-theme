# Material Theme

## Enjoy your theme!

Bothered by your old standard theme?

This might be the right one for you, different features and colors to better higlight the various keywords in different languages.

## Installation

Open command paette (Ctrl+Shift+P) &#8594; User Settings(json) &#8594; **"workbench.productIconTheme"**: **"enhanced-material-theme"**

Else

User Settings (UI) search for "Workbench: Color Theme" and set it to "Enhanced Matherial Theme"

### Compatibility

For the best experience we suggest using [material icon theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) from Philipp Kief

**Enjoy!**
